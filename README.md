# üß± UNICORN Baseline Template

This repository provides a **minimal working template** for participating in the [UNICORN Challenge](https://unicorn.grand-challenge.org/).<br>
It serves as a **starting point** for your own submission and implements the required boilerplate to run across all tasks in the challenge.

## üîç What It Does

This repository:
- Reads the challenge input for each task (e.g., image paths, report texts, etc.).
- Produces an output JSON file for each sample.
- Provides a dummy checksum-based feature extraction as a placeholder for real models for pathology and radiology vision tasks.

üì¶ This ensures your code is **compatible with the challenge evaluation pipeline**, even before you plug in a real model!

## üìÅ Structure

- `inference.py`: Main entry point for processing inputs and generating outputs.
- `vision/`: Contains modules for encoding and processing pathology and radiology images.
  - `pathology/`: Utilities and classes for handling pathology images.
    - `wsi.py`: Handles whole slide images and tile extraction.
    - `wsi_utils.py`: Utilities for tissue detection and contour processing.
    - `info.py`: Displays information about multi-resolution images.
    - `utils.py`: Helper functions for sorting coordinates and saving features.
  - `radiology/`: Utilities for handling radiology images.
    - `patch_extraction.py`: Extracts patches from 3D radiology images.
- `model/`: Placeholder for model-related resources.
  - `README.md`: Instructions for uploading or including models.
  - `a_tarball_subdirectory/`: Example subdirectory for tarball resources.
- `resources/`: Placeholder for other resources
- `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the container environment for running the algorithm.
- `do_build.sh`: Script to build the Docker container.
- `do_test_run.sh`: Script to test the container locally.
- `do_save.sh`: Script to save the container image and optional tarball for upload.

## üöÄ Getting Started

System requirements: Linux-based OS (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04) with Python 3.10+ and Docker installed.

Depending on your preferred way of working, you can follow our tutorial for:

1. [Local development with Docker](./setup-docker.md).
2. [Local development with Python virtual environment](./setup-venv.md) [experimental].

Note: we're working on adding the steps to provide the script with the necessary inputs, stay tuned!

The local Python virtual environment does not include the steps needed to create a Docker container that can be uploaded to Grand Challenge, for that please check out the Docker tutorial.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

- Modify `inference.py` to implement your own feature extraction or prediction logic.
- Add your model weights to the `model/` directory or upload them as a tarball to Grand Challenge.
- Update `requirements.in` to include additional Python dependencies and regenerate `requirements.txt` using `pip-compile`.
